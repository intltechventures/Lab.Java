  * "Riposte is a Netty-based microservice framework for rapid development of production-ready HTTP APIs. It includes robust features baked in like distributed tracing (provided by the Zipkin-compatible Wingtips), error handling and validation (pluggable implementation with the default provided by Backstopper), and circuit breaking (provided by Fastbreak). It works equally well as a fully-featured microservice by itself (see the template microservice project), or as an embedded HTTP server inside another application."
